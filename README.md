# CSharp-Random-Password-Generator

## Overview

Welcome to the **CSharp Random Password Generator** project! This is a simple yet effective **C# console application** that generates a random lowercase password using basic .NET features.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to create a quick utility for password generation using minimal code. It's ideal for beginners in C# or anyone looking for a lightweight tool to generate passwords.

## Project Structure

- **CSharp-Random-Password-Generator**: A standalone console application that:
  - Generates a random lowercase password.
  - Outputs the result to the console.
  - Is easily customizable for different password lengths or rules.

---

## Features

- Generates a random password of fixed length (default: 10 characters).
- Uses only lowercase alphabetic characters (`a` to `z`).
- Fast, clean, and minimal C# implementation.
- Easily configurable for different lengths or more complex character sets.

## How It Works

The application creates a new password by randomly selecting lowercase alphabetic characters and assembling them into a string. The length of the password can be easily changed within the code.
